# openITCOCKPIT-ce-docker customized DEV version
This is a slightly customized developer version, with OITC_DEBUG and ssh enabled.

It requires to have a file `id_ecdsa.pub` in the directory containing the compose.yml.

That file will be used as `/root/.ssh/authorized_keys` file within the main container.

You might have seen the `oitc-dev-dockerfile`. That will be used to customize the official container. Over this, the custom image is based on the nightly build of openitcockpit/openitcockpit-ce.

Start the application with `docker compose up --build` instead.
